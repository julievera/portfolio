<p>I'm Julie, a Boston-based digital advertising and marketing nerd, analyst, and builder of web experiences.</p>
<p>I'm also a founding partner of independent digital consulting firm, <a href="http://toypig.co">Toy Pig Co.</a></p>
<p>I started building websites at the age of 12 with a pirated copy of MS FrontPage. I never quite left the digital space.</p>
 <p>As a lifelong learner, I like to dabble in anything that deeply interests me. That's how I found myself as a music major in Northeastern. 10 years of clarinet-playing and 4 years of competitive marching band will do that to you.</p> 
<p>While a music <em>industry</em> major, I discovered the wonderful world of marketing, consumer behavior, and mass communication. This led me to write many-a-paper on this topic, including one that landed me a spot in the graduate Sociology program at Brandeis. Brandeis taught me to love numbers, specifically research statistics, which lends itself quite well to digital advertising.</p> 
<p>Seeking to understand more about the way that technology affects us on a macro level, I took a job as a search specialist at <a href="http://ovrdrv.com">Overdrive Interactive</a>. Eventually, I moved from MA to CA and continued my stint as a search specialist (and eventually Client Services Manager) with one of the top search agencies around, <a href="http://www.3qdigital.com">3Q Digital</a>. Briefly, I helped support the sales operations of a secret "media startup" supported by Intel.</p> 
<p>At the same time, for no reason in particular, I rekindled my love for building things. Mostly beautiful websites. Did I mention I started building them when I was 12? Anyway, Boston was calling. I moved back. Currently, I'm a senior analyst focusing on reporting, process optimization, and forecasting at <a href="http://www.digitaslbi.com/global/">DigitasLBi</a>.</p> <p>Wanting to push my boundaries in front-end web development, I enrolled at General Assembly's FEWD course. With my foot placed firmly in marketing and advertising, I seek to combine that experience with web development...</p>
